Python Variable Types: Local & Global
There are two types of variables in Python, Global variable and Local variable. When you want to use the same variable for rest of your program or module you declare it as a global variable, while if you want to use the variable in a specific function or method, you use a local variable while Python variable declaration.

Let’s understand this Python variable types with the difference between local and global variables in the below program.

Let us define variable in Python where the variable “f” is global in scope and is assigned value 101 which is printed in output
Variable f is again declared in function and assumes local scope. It is assigned value “I am learning Python.” which is printed out as an output. This Python declare variable is different from the global variable “f” defined earlier
Once the function call is over, the local variable f is destroyed. At line 12, when we again, print the value of “f” is it displays the value of global variable f=101
•While Python variable declaration using the keyword global, you can reference the global variable inside a function.

Variable “f” is global in scope and is assigned value 101 which is printed in output
Variable f is declared using the keyword global. This is NOT a local variable, but the same global variable declared earlier. Hence when we print its value, the output is 101
We changed the value of “f” inside the function. Once the function call is over, the changed value of the variable “f” persists. At line 12, when we again, print the value of “f” is it displays the value “changing global variable”

	A Name in Python Program is called Identifier.
•	It can be Class Name OR Function Name OR Module Name OR Variable Name.

•	a = 10

Rules to define Identifiers in Python:

1.	The only allowed characters in Python are

•	alphabet symbols(either lower case or upper case)
•	digits(0 to 9)
•	underscore symbol(_)

By mistake if we are using any other symbol like $ then we will get syntax error.

•	cash = 10 √
•	ca$h =20 (not allowed)

2.	Identifier should not starts with digit

•	123total (not allowed)
•	total123 √

3.	Identifiers are case sensitive. Of course Python language is case sensitive language.

•	total=10
•	TOTAL=999
•	print(total) #10
•	print(TOTAL) #999
Delete a variable
You can also delete Python variables using the command del “variable name”.

In the below example of Python delete variable, we deleted variable f, and when we proceed to print it, we get error “variable name is not defined” which means you have deleted the variable.
